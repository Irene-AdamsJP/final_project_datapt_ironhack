## **Presentation:**

- I have analyzed 3 companies: BBVA, Bankinter and CaixaBank
- 2 sources of data: data set of news and stock price data


Conclusion: The stock price of companies shows a tendency to change when the number of news items increases

## **Next steps:**

- Perform sentiment analysis to see if the news has a positive or negative component

- See what has more impact on stock value: positive news or negative news

- Perform a more exhaustive study, also analyzing the foreign press

- Automatic alert when there is a peak in news about user-defined companies


Thank you all!
